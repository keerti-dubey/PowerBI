**Heart Disease Risk Analysis Dashboard using Power BI**
🏢 Business Problem
Hospitals and healthcare providers need an efficient way to analyze and predict heart disease risk based on basic patient health metrics (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure).
Early detection enables proactive healthcare, cost reduction, and better patient outcomes.

🎯 Project Objective
Analyze patient health metrics (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)
Identify key factors that correlate with heart disease
Visualize important patterns and relationships
Enable dynamic filtering by gender, chest pain type, and age group
Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for real-time insights

🛠️ Tools Used
Power BI Desktop
Excel / CSV (for raw data)
Python (for correlation heatmap generation)
Canva (for dashboard backgrounds)

🔥 Dashboard Features
KPI Cards for Cholesterol, BP, MaxHR, Heart Disease Rate
Clustered Column Charts (Cholesterol and BP by Gender)
Scatter Plots showing correlation (e.g., Age vs MaxHR)
Correlation Matrix Heatmap - Python
Filters (Slicers) for Gender, Age Group, Heart Disease Status

📜 Data Source
Dataset used from Kaggle - Heart Disease Dataset

✨ How to Run the Project
Download the .pbix file.
Open it in Power BI Desktop.
Explore dashboard visuals and use filters to interact with data.
(Optional) Update the data by connecting to a new CSV.
